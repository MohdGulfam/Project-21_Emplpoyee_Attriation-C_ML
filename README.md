Employees are considered the backbone of an organization. The success or failure of the organization depends on the employees who work for an organization. Organizations must deal with the problems when trained, skilled and experienced employees leave the organization for better opportunities.
Employee attrition is downsizing in any organization where employees resign. Employees are valuable assets of any organization. It is necessary to know whether the employees are dissatisfied or whether there are other reasons for leaving their respective jobs.
